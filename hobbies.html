          <p>I first began learning how to code in secondary school in my Information Technology class. This was my first introduction to the world of web development.</p>
          <p>I realized that I enjoyed learning how websites were built and developed, after being assigned a project for class, which was to build our own website on a topic of our choice.</p>
          <p>Recently I've decided to get back into coding, and enjoy spending time practicing my skills as well as gaining new ones, whether it's by studying on an online course like Treehouse, or by building projects.</p>

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <img src="images/music.jpeg" alt="An image of me performing" class="cardimg">
          <p>I've been playing electric guitar and bass since the age of 15.</p>
          <p>I really enjoy the playing music, as it really brings out my creativity, and is a great way for me to express myself.</p>
          <p>Whether I'm practicing/playing music at home, or performing at gigs with my metal band, I'm always happy to be playing music.</p>
